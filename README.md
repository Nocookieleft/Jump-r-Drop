# ProjectSP Tower
final project minor programming by Anna Dechering stdnr: 10288384
a basic game based to exercise timing and hand-eye coordination while tackling boredom. 
The player times the jumps of an avatar climbing a 2D tower with missing platforms. Should the player fall from the screen, the game ends. The higher the player might climb, the higher the score. 



Features 
---------
- live action play
- highscores

Design
------

(sketches)



Obstacles
----------

- position of the screen: 
	the window should move along with the player according to its position (as the player climbs higher and higher)
- the (continuous) generating of the level by generating platform blocks:
	the platform sprite(s) should be placed at a constant distance from other blocks to provide the chance of climbing another platform.
	In other words: if the platform blocks are spaced too far from one another, the player cannot reach another platform and has no chance of ever progressing in the game.
- working with multiple game scenes: 
	moving from main menu to a new game or the highscores view
